Hi there! I'm Aashay. Iâ€™m a automobile engineer turned data analyst. Ever since I first learned how to program, while trying scientific computing for physics course, I have pursued programming as a passion, and as a career. Check out [my personal website](https://ash247.streamlit.app/) for more information on my other projects (including more fun interactions!), as well as some photos of my paintings, treks, surfing and of course photography.
